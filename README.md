# E-Commerce Funnel and Retention Analysis
### Optimizing Conversion Paths and Customer Lifetime Value

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to identify friction points in the sales funnel and evaluate long-term customer retention through cohort analysis. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to increase the conversion rate from product views to successful purchases and to develop strategies to mitigate customer churn.

## Business Problem
The analysis addresses two primary areas of the business:
1. **Conversion Funnel Efficiency:** Determining where potential customers drop off in the journey from visiting the site to completing a transaction.
2. **Customer Retention:** Understanding how long customers remain active after their initial purchase and identifying when the risk of churn is highest.

## Tech Stack and Methodology
* Tools: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Cohort Grids, Funnel Visualization)
* Data Source: E-commerce event logs (August 2020 - December 2020) containing user IDs, event types (view, cart, purchase), and product metadata.
* Metric Strategy: Used Unique User Counts rather than total events to ensure the analysis reflects individual human behavior rather than session volume.

## Key Insights

### 1. Funnel Performance
* **The "Add to Cart" Gap:** The most significant drop-off occurs between the product view and the "add to cart" stage. 
* **Growth Opportunity:** Improving product page engagement and streamlining the cart interface represents the highest potential for increasing final purchase volume.

### 2. Cohort Retention
* **Peak Retention:** Retention is consistently highest in the month immediately following the first purchase (Month 1).
* **Churn Trends:** Activity generally declines over the subsequent 4 months. Early cohorts (e.g., August 2020) show more stable long-term trends than newer ones.
* **Strategy Need:** The data indicates a clear need for a post-purchase re-engagement strategy to maximize customer lifetime value.

## Project Deliverables
* **Conversion Funnel Model:** A step-by-step breakdown of user movement from View > Cart > Purchase.
* **Retention Heatmap:** A cohort analysis table tracking user activity from Age 0 through Age 4.
* **Cleaned Event Log:** A structured dataset focusing on purchase events and unique user journey mapping.

## Strategic Recommendations
* **UX/UI Optimization:** Conduct A/B testing on product pages to address the "View to Cart" drop-off.
* **CRM Automation:** Implement targeted email or loyalty campaigns starting 30 days post-purchase to combat the natural decline in retention observed in Month 2.
* **Top-of-Funnel Focus:** While acquisition volume is high, focus on quality traffic that aligns with the "August Cohort" profile, which showed higher long-term stability.
